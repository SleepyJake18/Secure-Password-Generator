# Secure-Password-Generator
This will allow users to visit the site and, based on selected criteria, generate a randomized secure password. The password will change every time the generate password button is clicked.

The code takes in variables from prompts and confirms to determine which character set to use. From there, it will select and append them into a string that will then be displayed to the text area on the screen.
